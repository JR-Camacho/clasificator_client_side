# Client Documentation

This document provides an overview and guide for the client side of the project. The client is built using React and incorporates machine learning models in JSON format, which are located in the `public` folder.

## Project Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the client directory: `cd client-side`.
3. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`.

## Usage

To start the client application, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will launch the client in development mode and open it in your default browser. You can now explore the different features and functionalities of the application.

## Machine Learning Models

The machine learning models used in this project are stored in the `public/models/` folder. They are in JSON format and can be accessed and utilized within the client application. These models are trained and optimized for specific tasks, such as image classification or handwritten digit recognition.

## Folder Structure

The main components and files within the client folder are organized as follows:

`src/components`: Contains reusable components used throughout the application.
`src/features`: Contains feature-specific components like pages, components, routes of every module. 
`src/helpers`: Contains helper functions modules used across the application.
`src/pages`: Contains individual pages/components that make up the different sections of the application.
`src/layouts`: Contains layout components that define the overall structure and styling of the application.
`src/routes`: Contains route configuration files for defining the application's navigation paths.
`src/utilities`: Contains utility consts used across the application.
